Create a Virtual Environment:
Navigate to your project directory and run:
virtualenv venv

Activate the Virtual Environment:
In Command Prompt, you can activate the virtual environment with
.\venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Ensure Your Virtual Environment is Activated:
You should see the name of your virtual environment (e.g., (venv))
at the beginning of your command line prompt. This indicates that 
any Python packages you install will only affect this virtual environment, 
rather than your global Python installation.
